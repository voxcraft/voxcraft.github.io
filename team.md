**Sam Kriegman**
is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University.
His [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DCIwaLwAAAAJ) explores the AI-driven automated design of [robots](https://virtualcreatures.github.io/) and [biological machines](https://cdorgs.github.io/).
This involves the 
dynamical simulation of soft body systems,
simulation-to-reality transfer of physical artifacts,
and designing the form of functional systems that have limited neural control or none at all.

**Michael Levin** 
is the Vannevar Bush Chair Professor in the department of biology, and the director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University. His group works at the intersection of developmental biology and computer science, using molecular biophysics and in silico modeling to understand how cellular collectives make decisions about dynamic anatomy during embryogenesis, regeneration, and metamorphosis. By modeling and manipulating the computations occurring in non-neural bioelectrical networks (using for example optogenetics), the team is learning to re-write the large-scale pattern memories that guide growth and form in vivo. Specific practical applications in the Levin lab include repair of birth defects, induction of complex organ regeneration, tumor reprogramming, and synthetic morphology to create functional novel living machines. Fundamental aspects of the work concern expanding the understanding of neural and non-neural plasticity in the brain:body interface, the relationship between genome and anatomy, and the application of preneural cellular learning mechanisms (basal cognition) into novel approaches for artificial intelligence.
